# ikth-counter-v7-webpack-dockercompose-jsrouter-2022

## Status

- 20220213:
  - _successful in creating js router using popstate event / dispatchEvent() / etc. So I would like to keep this as template in case I wanted to use it_
  - _FAILED in creating a working development docker with volume. I spend the whole day on this. Could not get it to work with neither `Dockerfile.dev` (VOLUME) or docker-compose. But I did create a `docker-compose.yml` file_
    - _Successful in deploying with Heroku, however it is just a simple node server, would be interesting with other images too_
  - _successful in using sass & bootstrap together. Even created custom file & etc_
  - _counter did not finish but other things I mostly did_
